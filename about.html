              I'm a product designer who thrives at the intersection of creativity, technology, and tangible impact. My background in Digital and Interaction Design at Politecnico di Milano taught me to see challenges not as barriers, but as invitations to innovate.
              Before AI became mainstream, I was already exploring Machine Learning for designers in my thesis work. That curiosity led me to spend 4+ years as a UX/UI designer in agency life, where I led projects for national and international clients, transforming complex problems into intuitive, accessible experiences.

           <p class="animation-title">
            <strong>Curiosity as a Method</strong>: Every project starts with "what if...?" I've earned certifications in Machine Learning (Stanford) and AI (Reactor) not to become a developer, but to design what others think is impossible. Understanding technology deeply allows me to push boundaries strategically.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Making Ideas Real</strong>: I believe in thinking through making. Whether soldering an ESP32 for a smart egg holder or programming an AR experience, I turn concepts into working prototypes that people can touch, use, and feel. Prototypes tell truths that sketches can't.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Accessibility as Standard</strong>: Designing for everyone isn't a constraint—it's a superpower. From working with autistic children to conducting WCAG accessibility audits, inclusive design is embedded in my process from day one, not added as an afterthought.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Data-Informed Iteration</strong>: I combine qualitative insights with quantitative metrics to validate design decisions and measure real impact. Good design isn't just beautiful—it's measurably effective.

            <strong>Machine Learning Certified</strong>(Stanford University) - I design WITH AI, not just interfaces for it
            <br><br>
            <strong>Maker Mindset</strong> - 3D printing, circuit soldering, coding: I remove constraints by building solutions myself
            <br><br>
            <strong>Workshop Facilitator</strong> - Led AI and design workshops for 17+ professionals, translating complex concepts into actionable insights
            <br><br>
            <strong>Fast Problem-Solver</strong> - Like the time I rescued a critical client project by reimagining the entire UX during a live meeting

              I'm looking for a team that doesn't settle for "this is how it's always been done." A place where my obsession with innovation translates into products that genuinely improve people's lives—not just incrementally, but meaningfully.<br><br>
              I'm drawn to challenges that combine sustainability, emerging technology, and social impact. The future of design isn't just beautiful—it's purposeful, accessible, and built with intention.

            I'm someone who learns by doing, in everything I pursue:<br><br>
            <strong>Renovating my home</strong> - Created a complete 3D model to plan every detail, then learned tiling, wall demolition, and electrical systems to bring it to life
            <br><br>
            <strong>Fitness & running</strong> - Currently training to become a personal trainer and recently completed my first half marathon
            <br><br>
            <strong>Creative exploration</strong> - From gel nail art to travel planning, I approach every interest with the same curiosity I bring to design
            <br><br>
            <strong>Mentoring</strong> - Supporting young designers exploring AI and emerging technologies
            <br><br>
            This isn't just variety—it's a mindset. When you genuinely enjoy learning how systems work (whether that's tile adhesion or user flows), you develop pattern recognition that makes you a better problem-solver across domains.
